1. # <a name="_29cp0gkd2ju8"></a>**Summary**
- For our team Accord, we believe that the project has made significant progress in implementing various functionalities such as registration, login, linking, friend list display, chat history display, server list display, and live messaging. These functionalities have undergone ad-hoc, unit, and black-box testing to ensure their correctness and reliability. However, some features are still under development, notably the state-validation functionality, which impacts the accuracy of user data display.
- Process:
  - Our team has adopted a structured approach to testing, utilizing ad-hoc, unit, and black-box testing in the current phase, with plans to incorporate integration testing, acceptance testing, and usability testing in the future. The division of testing approaches aligns well with the development cycle, with ad-hoc testing for quick checks, unit testing for feature validation, and black-box testing for component verification. However, the team may need to ensure better synchronization between testing and development to address ongoing issues with state validation functionality.
- Quality Assurance:
  - To ensure the quality of the source code, the team has implemented various measures. Firstly, they have integrated unit testing into their development process, writing test cases for features before implementation. This helps catch bugs early and ensures that features meet specified requirements. Additionally, the team has employed ad-hoc testing for quick validation and black-box testing to simulate user interactions and verify component functionality. However, to further improve quality, the team should prioritize the completion of the state-validation functionality, which is crucial for accurate data display. Additionally, incorporating integration testing, acceptance testing, and usability testing in the future will provide comprehensive validation of the application's functionality and user experience. Overall, while the project has made good progress, there is room for refinement in the testing process and completion of critical functionalities for enhanced quality assurance.
