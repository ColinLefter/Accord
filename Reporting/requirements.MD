# Requirements Engineering

## Project High-Level Description

Accord will act as an engaging social platform where users can leverage our feature-rich instant messaging interface to chat and hang out with friends and communities. Our platform will support peer-to-peer direct messaging as well as group conversations. Discussions can take place through group chats or discussion servers that are dedicated to supporting context-driven conversations via roles and threads.

We believe that everyone has the right to privacy, which is why we will offer end-to-end encryption across all our messaging services. Users will have access to a range of privacy controls that allow for flexible user interactions--from specifying the duration of message history to deleting all chat history after every discussion through private mode, we believe in prioritizing user-driven data privacy.

Communities are central to our platform, and we intend to put the user in control of how they engage with communities through server roles and permissions. Owners of discussion servers can assign roles and permissions to participating users.
