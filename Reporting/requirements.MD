# Requirements Engineering

## About the project

Accord is an engaging social platform where users can leverage our feature-rich instant messaging interface to chat and hang out with friends and communities. We are building a full-stack web application that uses React and TypeScript for the front end and Python for the back end, along with a MySQL database. In addition, we are using Next.js as the React framework for our front end and Django as our Python-based web framework for our back end.

Our front-end tech stack aligns with the increasing popularity of Next.js as the top choice for full-stack web development while leveraging the strict type-checking properties of TypeScript that improve our development workflow by simplifying the process of test-driven development. Our choice to use Django for our back-end enables us to develop the encryption-oriented peer-to-peer direct messaging feature that is central to our application.

## High-level description

Our platform will support peer-to-peer direct messaging as well as group conversations. Discussions take place through group chats or discussion servers dedicated to context-driven conversations via roles and threads. We believe everyone has the right to privacy, and offering end-to-end encryption across all our messaging services allows us to accomplish our ambition. Users will have access to a range of privacy controls that allow for flexible user interactions——from specifying the duration of message history to deleting all chat history after every discussion through private mode, user-driven data privacy is our priority.

Communities are central to our platform, and we intend to put users in control of how they engage with communities through server roles and permissions. Owners of discussion servers can assign roles and permissions to participating users. Users design these servers with purpose by organizing discussions through text channels that act as individual conversation threads.
