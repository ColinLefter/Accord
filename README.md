# COSC-310-Group-Project
## M2 Update
### Introduction

Accord is an engaging social platform where users can leverage our feature-rich instant
messaging interface to chat and hang out with friends and communities. We are building a
full-stack web application that uses React and TypeScript for the front-end and Python for
the back-end, along with a MySQL database. In addition, we are using Next.js as the React
framework for our front-end and Django as our Python-based web framework for our
back-end.

Our front-end tech stack aligns with the increasing popularity of Next.js as the top choice
for full-stack web development while leveraging the strict type-checking properties of
TypeScript that improve our development workflow by simplifying the process of
test-driven development. Our choice to use Django for our back-end enables us to develop
the encryption-oriented peer-to-peer direct messaging feature that is central to our
application. Furthermore, it allows us to store our site-wide database on the same server.

### High-level description

Our platform will support peer-to-peer direct messaging as well as group conversations.

Discussions take place through group chats or discussion servers dedicated to
context-driven conversations via roles and threads. We believe everyone has the right to
privacy, and offering end-to-end encryption across all our messaging services allows us to
accomplish our ambition. Users will have access to a range of privacy controls that allow for
flexible user interactionsâ€”from specifying the duration of message history to deleting all
chat history after every discussion through private mode, user-driven data privacy is our
priority.

Communities are central to our platform, and we intend to put users in control of how they
engage with communities through server roles. Owners of discussion servers can assign
roles to participating users to drive user engagement. Users design these servers with
purpose by organizing discussions through text channels that act as individual conversation
threads.
